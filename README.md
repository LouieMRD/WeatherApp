<h1 style="color: lightgrey">Weather App</h1>

<p style="color: lightgrey">
This is a weather app that displays the temperature, wind speed
and weather condition (i.e. rainy, clear, snowy ect.). It allows users to 
input a city of their choosing and get the corresponding weather information
related to it. 
</p>

<h2 style="color: lightgrey">How it Works</h2>
<p style="color: lightgrey">
I used the 'OpenWeather API' to get the weather data and a site called 'Postman' to get the 
response from the API call. 
The site calls the 'OpenWeather API' using javascript promises and then accesses the 
response (a json file) and then inserts the json variables into HTML to display the results.

The form submitted in which you state where you want the weather data from is inserted into the Postman API call at 
the part that states where you want the weather data from. 

<h2 style="color: lightgrey">
  Progress
</h2>
<p style="color: lightgrey">
  This project is still a work in progress and will be added too in the future. The main goal of the project has been completed (a working API call
  to get live weather data and displaying it) but there are some design changes to be made.
